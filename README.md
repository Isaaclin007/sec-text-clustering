# Topic Modelling SEC Text Data
 ðŸ“„ Clustering public companies based on their SEC report filings

## Description ##

Companies are often sorted into sectors (retail, tech, ...) according to some accepted classification standard (SIC, GICS, ...).  
Historically, companies within the same sector or product space exhibit correlation, ie.
they tend to move in tandem in reaction to market shocks. However, traditional classification standards might be inefficient 
in capturing similarities between companies or products. This project prototypes an unsupervised NLP 
approach to measuring similarity between companies by performing topic modelling on yearly 10-k report 
filings submitted by each company to the SEC. These filings lay out a description of the company, its markets and 
products and hence are well suited for the task. 

The prototype results are located in the python notebook. An HTML export is provided as well.
